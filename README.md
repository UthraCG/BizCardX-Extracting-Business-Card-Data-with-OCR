EDA Process:

EDA is one of the most important phases in data science since it helps us to 
obtain critical insights and statistical metrics. In general, EDA can be categorised 
in two ways.
The first distinction is that each method is either non-graphical or graphical.
Second, each method is univariate or multivariate in nature (usually just 
bivariate).
Non-graphical approaches typically include the computation of summary 
statistics, but graphical methods clearly summarize the data in a diagrammatic 
or pictorial manner.
Let's look at each type individually.
